# Not-So-Obvious Features

- **Collapse/expand sections** Click on any heading (e.g., `###`) to fold or unfold that section.
- **Subtle dividers**   `<hr>` or `---` are rendered with minimal styling, so they can separate text blocks without standing out.


# Known Issues:
Due to margin changes, the end of the document is sometimes not clickable.
Workaround: Insert blank lines.
